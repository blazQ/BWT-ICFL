# BWT-ICFL
A new approach to the traditional BWT, using ICFL.
## What's all this stuff?
Contains source codes for simplified factorizations, sample implementation for traditional BWT and BWT with CFL using naive methods and the source code for the new approach.
Also contains an example main file that can read a file, passed by argument, or from stdin. The output is then either stdout or a redirected file.
It is used in the context of a broader compression pipeline that uses various transformation and a form of arithmetic encoding to compress an input file.
